The [BeamNG-MATLAB bridge](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNG-MATLAB-integration) is depending on [BeamNG.Tech](https://documentation.beamng.com/beamng_tech/) and [BeamNGpy](https://documentation.beamng.com/beamng_tech/beamngpy/). Make sure that you have the license for BeamNG.Tech. The Github repository of the BeamNG-MATLAB has some basic examples of scripts that run a vehicle with some sensors ex. Lidar, Camera, and state sensor. 


### Vehicle State Plotting
#### Use the state sensor to plot some graphs of the vehicle position, wheel speed and direction, throttle, and brake.

### Running Lidar sensor, and AI control. 
#### Create a simple scenario
#### Use the simulator's AI with BeamNGpy

### Multi-shot Camera    
#### Change the position and rotation of a camera

### Object Placement    
#### Define a custom scenario for a given map
#### Generate procedural content, i.e. simple meshes

### Annotation and Bounding Boxes
#### Get semantic annotations
#### Get instance annotations
#### Graw bounding boxes (note that this feature is not ready for use yet)
